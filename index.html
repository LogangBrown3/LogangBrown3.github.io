<h1>The Best Sport "Cross Country"</h1>
<!-- Paragraph 1-->
<p>I have done cross country for many years, I started when I was in 5th grade. The reason I joined was because I always had tons of energy, and there is no better way to use
     up energy than running. I haven't always been excited for the next season, but my teammates keep it fun and interesting.
</p>
<!-- Paragraph 2-->
<p> Its better than other sports because you dont have to sit out the whole time, you will always be racing. Each course is different, so if you like the outdoors it never
     gets boring.</p>
<!-- Paragraph 3-->
<p>The funniest thing that happened in cross country is that my teammate Bryant used to fall off a bridge almost every time there was one. Another fun experience is during
     halloween season the high schoolers hide somewhere in the woods and we get to scare the little kids while they run their warmup.</p>
